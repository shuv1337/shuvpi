# Shuvpi Packages

Shuvpi packages install and distribute extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes as one unit. Use a package when a customization should be shared through npm or git, or when several resources belong together.

A package is an ordinary directory or npm package. It can expose conventional resource directories, declare explicit paths under the `shuvpi` key in `package.json`, and carry its own runtime dependencies.

## Install and manage packages

Install from npm, git, or a local path:

```bash
shuvpi install npm:@example/shuvpi-tools@1.0.0
shuvpi install git:github.com/example/shuvpi-tools@v1
shuvpi install ./local-package
```

`shuvpi list` shows configured packages. Use `shuvpi remove <source>` to remove one and `shuvpi update --extensions` to reconcile package installations. See [Command Line](cli.md#package-commands) for every package command and option.

Personal installs are written to `~/.shuvpi/agent/settings.json`. Add `--local` or `-l` to write the package declaration to `.shuvpi/settings.json`. Shuvpi reads declarations from that file only after project trust is granted.

Project packages are installed and loaded only after project trust is resolved. Packages can execute extension code and can include skills that instruct the model to run programs. Review third-party package source before installing it. Review project package declarations before granting project trust.

Use `--extension` or `-e` to try a package for one invocation without adding it to settings:

```bash
shuvpi -e npm:@example/shuvpi-tools
```

## Choose a source

| Source | Example | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| npm | `npm:@example/shuvpi-tools@1.0.0` | Installed under the Shuvpi npm directory |
| git | `git:github.com/example/shuvpi-tools@v1` | Cloned and reconciled to the selected ref |
| URL | `https://github.com/example/shuvpi-tools` | Treated as a git source |
| Local | `./shuvpi-tools` | Loaded from the resolved path without copying |

Versioned npm specifications are pinned. Git tags and commits are also pinned; package updates reconcile the checkout but do not move a configured ref.

Relative local paths resolve from the settings file that contains them. A file path loads one extension. A directory follows normal package discovery rules.

## Create a package

The simplest package uses conventional directories:

```text
my-shuvpi-package/
├── package.json
├── extensions/
├── skills/
├── prompts/
└── themes/
```

Without a `shuvpi` manifest, Shuvpi discovers TypeScript and JavaScript extensions, skill directories, Markdown prompts, and JSON themes from those directories.

Use an explicit manifest when resources live elsewhere or need filtering:

```json
{
  "name": "my-shuvpi-package",
  "keywords": ["shuvpi-package"],
  "shuvpi": {
    "extensions": ["./src/extension.ts"],
    "skills": ["./resources/skills"],
    "prompts": ["./resources/prompts/*.md"],
    "themes": ["./resources/themes/*.json"]
  }
}
```

Paths are relative to the package root. Arrays accept glob patterns and exclusions. List dot-prefixed or symlinked resource roots directly when traversal through a glob would not discover them.

The `shuvpi-package` keyword makes an npm package eligible for discovery in the [Shuvpi package gallery](https://pi.dev/packages). Optional `shuvpi.image` and `shuvpi.video` fields add gallery previews.

## Declare dependencies

Put runtime packages imported by extensions in `dependencies`. Shuvpi installs package dependencies when it installs an npm or git source.

Shuvpi supplies these packages to extensions and skills:

- `@shuv1337/shuvpi-ai`
- `@shuv1337/shuvpi-agent-core`
- `@shuv1337/shuvpi-coding-agent`
- `@shuv1337/shuvpi-tui`
- `typebox`

Declare imported Shuvpi packages in `peerDependencies` with a `"*"` range and do not bundle them. Other Shuvpi packages used as dependencies must be included in the published tarball and referenced through their `node_modules` resource paths.

Installed packages load with separate module roots. Do not rely on two packages sharing one dependency instance or one package resolving another package’s undeclared dependency.

## Select package resources

The object form in settings narrows which resources load from a package:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "source": "npm:@example/shuvpi-tools",
      "extensions": ["extensions/*.ts", "!extensions/legacy.ts"],
      "skills": [],
      "prompts": ["prompts/review.md"]
    }
  ]
}
```

For each resource type:

- Omit the property to load everything allowed by the package.
- Use `[]` to load none of that type.
- Use `!pattern` to exclude glob matches.
- Use `+path` to include one exact allowed path.
- Use `-path` to exclude one exact path.

Filters narrow the package manifest. They do not expose resources that the package itself did not declare.

Run `shuvpi config` to enable or disable discovered resources. It starts with personal configuration; press Tab to switch scope, or run `shuvpi config --local` to start with project overrides.

## Understand scope and identity

The same package can appear in personal and project settings. A project entry normally replaces the personal entry. With `autoload: false`, the project entry instead acts as a filtering delta over the personal package.

Shuvpi identifies npm packages by package name, git packages by repository URL without the ref, and local packages by resolved absolute path. This prevents the same package from loading twice through equivalent declarations.

Use [Extensions](extensions.md), [Skills](skills.md), [Prompt Templates](prompt-templates.md), and [Themes](themes.md) to design each resource before packaging it.
